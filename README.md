# Banking-Customer-Churn-Prediction-and-Analysis

	Developed algorithms for telecommunications service vendors to predict customer churn probability based on labeled data via Python programming.

	Preprocessed data set by data cleaning, categorical feature transformation and standardization, etc.

	Trained supervised machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors, and applied regularization with optimal parameters to overcome overfitting.

	Evaluated model performance of classification (F1 score 0.545) via k-fold cross-validation technique and analyzed feature importance to identify top factors that influenced the results.
